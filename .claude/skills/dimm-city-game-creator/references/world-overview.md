# Dimm City - World Overview

## Creaturepunk Aesthetic
"Coagulated blood in the wire, hairballs in the circuitry, a roar tearing through static."

Animal-folk (Sporos) with cybernetics + magic + tech. Gritty, visceral, weird. The city don't love you—that makes you dangerous.

## Five Districts
**The Burrows**: Underground warrens, scrappy survivors, cramped communal desperation
**Tech District**: Etherwave Transit Hub, glitching surveillance, corporate towers
**Neon District**: Gang wars, pleasure dens, chrome and blood, cats vs rabbits
**The Wastes**: Toxic beauty, mutated life, scavenger clans, poisoned ruins
**The Dark**: Reality glitches, forbidden zones, things that shouldn't exist

## Sensory Palette
**Sight**: Flickering neon, rust/chrome, hologram haze, bioluminescent fungi, blood on pavement
**Sound**: Pulse cannons, sirens, glitchy ads, bass, skittering
**Smell**: Burnt oil, ozone, cordite, garbage, toxic chemicals
**Touch**: Rain-slick metal, sticky floors, concrete, machinery vibration
**Taste**: Metallic air, acrid smoke, synthetic food
