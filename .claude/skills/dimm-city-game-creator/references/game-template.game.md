## Who You Are

**Describe the protagonist's identity and current situation.**

Tell the player who they are playing as. What is their role? What makes them unique? What skills or knowledge do they bring to this desperate situation?

Example: "You are a time traveler stranded in a dystopian future, desperately trying to repair your damaged time machine before the authorities discover you."

## What Happened

**Explain the inciting incident that created this crisis.**

How did the protagonist end up in this dire situation? What went wrong? Set the scene for the player - help them understand the weight of their circumstances.

Example: "Your journey through time went catastrophically wrong. The temporal distortion field destabilized, throwing you into an unknown era."

## Your Goal

**Define what the player is trying to achieve.**

What must they accomplish to win? What's at stake if they fail? Make the goal clear and meaningful. This should connect to your Primary Success card's narrative.

Example: "You must gather the necessary components and knowledge to repair your time machine and return home. But in this dark future, every action draws unwanted attention, and failure means being lost in time forever."

## Card Deck

<!-- ============================================================================
CARD TYPE OVERVIEW (YOU MAY DELETE THIS REFERENCE)
================================================================================

Based on Wretched and Alone SRD mechanics:

1. PRIMARY SUCCESS (1 card - Ace of Hearts)
   - The salvation card - your main path to victory
   - Activates win condition: places 10 tokens, begins countdown
   - Per SRD: "may come with a final pull from the tower" - even victory carries risk
   - This should be the most meaningful, hopeful moment in your narrative

2. FAILURE COUNTER (4 cards - all Kings)
   - Escalating existential threats
   - Revealing all 4 Kings = instant game over
   - Each should feel substantial and dangerous
   - Even-ranked (no damage checks)

3. NARRATIVE (3 cards - remaining Aces: A♦, A♣, A♠)
   - SRD term: "Bonus or help in your plight"
   - Reflective moments, emotional beats, small victories
   - Each Ace adds +1 to bonus counter (reduces damage)
   - Optional: Assign special one-time modifiers to up to 2 cards:
     * "skip-damage" - skip next damage check once
     * "return-king" - shuffle a previously drawn King back into deck once
   - Optional: May assign a challenge modifier to for a failure check along with another optional modifier

4. CHALLENGE (16 cards - odd ranks: 3, 5, 7, 9)
   - Usually trigger damage checks (tower pulls)
   - Immediate dangers, conflicts, disasters
   - Create tension through resource depletion risk
   - Balance: 4-6 severe threats, 10-12 moderate dangers

5. EVENT (28 cards - even ranks: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, J, Q)
   - Usually safe from damage
   - Respite, discovery, world-building, neutral moments
   - Balance: 10-12 helpful, 10-12 neutral, 6-8 bittersweet
   - These cards let players breathe and develop story

CARD COUNT REQUIREMENTS:
- 1 Primary Success (required)
- 4 Failure Counters (required)
- 3 Narrative cards total (required), optionally with modifiers
- 16 Challenge cards (required)
- 28 Event cards (required)
Total: 52 cards (standard deck)

WRITING TIPS:
- Cards can be short descriptions only, or include longer narrative text
- Focus on story and emotion - the system handles deck construction
- Consider thematic suit matching (optional):
  * Hearts = people, relationships
  * Diamonds = resources, discoveries
  * Clubs = places, environments
  * Spades = technology, systems

============================================================================ -->

### Primary Success

**[Short description - your salvation moment]**

[Optional longer narrative - this is your biggest reveal, make it meaningful and hopeful]

This card should represent the moment when genuine hope becomes possible. Consider making this a person (ally/mentor), discovery (crucial knowledge), or breakthrough (final piece needed).

Remember: Even with this revealed, winning requires removing 10 tokens at 1/6 chance per round, and surviving the final damage check.

---

### Failure Counter

**[First major threat - describe the danger]**

[Optional longer narrative expanding on the threat]

Consider progression: This first King could be an external threat emerging.

---

### Failure Counter

**[Second major setback - escalate the danger]**

[Optional longer narrative]

Consider progression: This second King could be loss of resources or safety.

---

### Failure Counter

**[Third catastrophe - deepen the crisis]**

[Optional longer narrative]

Consider progression: This third King could be getting lost or trapped.

---

### Failure Counter

**[Fourth and final disaster - the end is near]**

[Optional longer narrative]

Consider progression: This final King represents ultimate catastrophic failure. When revealed, the game ends immediately.

---

### Narrative: skip-damage

**[A moment of incredible luck or perfect timing]**

[Optional longer narrative - describe how the protagonist avoids danger this time]

This card provides a one-time ability to skip the next damage check when instructed. Use narrative to convey this mechanically: "when danger comes next, you'll be prepared" or "this shields you from the next threat."

Strategic value: Players will save this for critical low-resource moments.

---

### Narrative: return-king

**[A second chance emerges against all odds]**

[Optional longer narrative - describe how a catastrophic setback can be undone]

This card provides a one-time ability to shuffle a previously drawn King back into the deck. Use narrative to convey reversal or undoing: "you find a way to reverse what seemed irreversible" or "the catastrophe can be unwound."

Strategic value: This resets the failure counter, providing critical relief.

---

### Narrative

**[Third narrative card - a reflective or emotional beat]**

[Optional longer narrative - this should provide hope, beauty, or meaning]

This third Narrative card has no special mechanics - it's purely for character development, emotional processing, or world-building that reminds players why they're fighting.

Consider: a moment of unexpected beauty, connection to what was lost, or realization about self/situation.

---

### Challenge

**[Short description - immediate danger that triggers damage check]**

[Optional longer narrative]

This is Challenge 1 of 16. These usually trigger damage checks (tower pulls). Write immediate dangers, conflicts, accidents, hostile encounters, disasters, equipment failures, or environmental hazards.

Balance across all 28: aim for 10-12 genuinely helpful, 10-12 neutral/observational, 6-8 bittersweet.
