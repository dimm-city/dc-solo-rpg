# Introduction

## Who You Are

You are a time traveler stranded in a dystopian future, desperately trying to
repair your damaged time machine before the authorities discover you.

## What Happened

Your journey through time went catastrophically wrong. The temporal distortion
field destabilized, throwing you into an unknown era. The time machine's core
systems are failing, and you're running out of time.

## Your Goal

You must gather the necessary components and knowledge to repair your time
machine and return home. But in this dark future, every action draws unwanted
attention, and failure means being lost in time forever.

# You find a survivor who knows how to repair the time machine

This survivor is an engineer from before the collapse. She recognizes your time
machine's design and offers to help. With her expertise, you finally have a real
chance of getting home. She'll need time to study the damage, but hope fills
your heart for the first time since you arrived.

Her name is Dr. Chen, and she was part of the team that first theorized temporal
mechanics. She thought she was the last one who understood the technology.
Finding you, and your machine, has reignited something in her eyes - purpose.

# You discover a hidden stash of resources

Behind a false wall in an abandoned building, you find a prepper's cache:
canned food, clean water, tools, and even some medical supplies. Everything
is still sealed and usable. This discovery gives you the resources you need
to survive while working on the time machine.

<!-- card: A♣ -->

# You find a map of the city, helping you navigate safely

The map shows safe routes, danger zones, and even marks locations of interest.
Someone took the time to update this after the collapse, marking radiation
zones and mutant territories. With this knowledge, you can avoid the worst
dangers and find the parts you need more efficiently.
