# Welcome to the Future

## Who

You are a time traveler, an explorer of the temporal realms, who has accidentally landed in a dystopian future. This future is a grim shadow of the world you once knew, where society has collapsed, and dangerous creatures roam the streets. You are alone, with only your wits and the remnants of your time machine to aid you.

## What

Your mission is to survive in this harsh and unfamiliar world, while trying to repair your time machine. You'll need to scavenge for resources, navigate through the ruins of the city, interact with other survivors, and deal with the remnants of technology that have taken on a life of their own. Each card drawn will present a new challenge or opportunity, shaping your story as you try to make it back to your own time. Will you find the salvation you seek, or will the countdown to failure catch up with you? Only time will tell.
