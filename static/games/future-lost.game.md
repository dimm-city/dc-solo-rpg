## Who You Are

You are a time traveler stranded in a dystopian future, desperately trying to repair your damaged time machine before the authorities discover you.

## What Happened

Your journey through time went catastrophically wrong. The temporal distortion field destabilized, throwing you into an unknown era. The time machine's core systems are failing, and you're running out of time.

## Your Goal

You must gather the necessary components and knowledge to repair your time machine and return home. But in this dark future, every action draws unwanted attention, and failure means being lost in time forever.

# Card Deck

### Primary Success

**You find a survivor who knows how to repair the time machine**

This survivor is an engineer from before the collapse. She recognizes your time machine's design and offers to help. With her expertise, you finally have a real chance of getting home. She'll need time to study the damage, but hope fills your heart for the first time since you arrived.

Her name is Dr. Chen, and she was part of the team that first theorized temporal mechanics. She thought she was the last one who understood the technology. Finding you, and your machine, has reignited something in her eyes - purpose.

"I thought I'd die here without ever finishing my work," she tells you, her hands already examining the quantum field generator. "But maybe... maybe we can both go home."

---

### Failure Counter

**A group of hostile survivors has spotted you**

They move through the ruins with purpose, weapons ready. You recognize the look in their eyes - they've survived by taking from others, and they've marked you as their next target.

You have minutes, maybe less, to escape. They're coordinating, surrounding you. This isn't random violence - it's organized predation.

---

### Failure Counter

**Your stash of resources is stolen**

You return to your hideout to find it ransacked. Everything you'd carefully gathered - food, tools, spare parts - gone. Someone was watching, waiting for you to leave.

The violation leaves you vulnerable and paranoid. How long were they observing? What else do they know? Trust is dangerous, but so is isolation.

---

### Failure Counter

**You get lost in a dangerous part of the city**

The streets all look the same in the ruins. You took a wrong turn somewhere, and now you're deep in territory marked "EXTREME HAZARD" on every map you've found.

The radiation detector in your pocket is clicking faster. You need to find your way out, but every direction looks equally threatening.

---

### Failure Counter

**The time machine suffers a major malfunction**

A cascade failure tears through the temporal matrix. Sparks fly, systems go dark, and your heart sinks as you see the damage. This isn't something you can fix with scavenged parts.

This will require miracles. Or at least, very specific pre-collapse technology that might not exist anymore.

---

#### Narrative: skip-damage

**A moment of perfect timing saves you**

In the chaos of your escape from the collapsing structure, something impossible happens. A piece of falling debris that should have crushed you catches on a support beam at the last second. A gas leak that should have ignited doesn't. A patrol that should have spotted you turns the other way.

The universe aligns in your favor, just this once. You make it through unscathed, heart pounding, knowing that next time you face danger, you might not be so lucky.

But for now, you're alive. And sometimes, in this broken world, that's the only miracle you need.

---

#### Narrative: return-king

**A second chance manifests from the darkness**

Against all odds, you discover a flaw in the hostile survivors' operation. They're not as organized as you thought - their leader made a critical mistake, and you've found it.

With this knowledge, you can undo what seemed irreversible. The catastrophe they caused can be unwound, the damage repaired, the threat neutralized. It will take everything you have, but you can make this right.

Sometimes the universe gives you a chance to rewrite your failures. This is yours.

---

### Narrative

**A connection across time**

Late at night, working on the time machine by candlelight, you have a strange thought: somewhere in the past, before the collapse, the younger version of Dr. Chen is making the theoretical breakthroughs that will save you.

She doesn't know it yet. She might be a grad student, staying up late in a lab, frustrated that her equations don't quite work. But they will. And decades later, her older self will use that knowledge to send you home.

Time isn't a line - it's a web, connecting moments and people across centuries. You're part of that web now.

---

### Challenge

**You're betrayed by a survivor you trusted**

You thought you had made an ally, someone who understood the value of cooperation in this harsh world. But they led you into an ambush, and their friends took everything you were carrying.

You managed to escape, but the betrayal stings worse than your injuries. Trust, you realize, is the rarest resource in this world.

---

### Challenge

**A group of survivors tries to steal your supplies**

You hear them before you see them - whispers and footsteps. They think you're an easy mark, alone and distracted. But you've survived too long to be caught off guard.

The confrontation is tense, weapons drawn, until they realize you're not worth the risk. They back off, but you know you'll need to be more careful.

---

### Challenge

**You're injured in a fight with a survivor**

The scavenger came out of nowhere, desperate and violent. You managed to drive them off, but not before they got a knife into your side.

The wound isn't fatal, but it's serious. You need to clean it, bind it, and hope infection doesn't set in. Medical supplies are precious, and you're running low.

---

### Challenge

**You fall into a trap set by other survivors**

The floor gives way beneath you, and you plummet into a pit lined with scrap metal. Above you, laughter echoes as figures peer down.

They don't take your supplies - they just leave you there. It takes hours to climb out, and by then you've lost valuable time. Were they just cruel, or was this a distraction?

---

### Challenge

**You're caught in a dispute between survivor factions**

You stumbled into the middle of a territorial fight. Both sides assume you're with the other. Bullets fly, and you're pinned down, trying desperately to signal that you're not involved.

When the shooting stops, both sides are watching you. You have seconds to convince them you're not a threat.

---

### Challenge

**You're exposed to harmful radiation while scavenging**

The detector started screaming too late. You'd already been in the hot zone for several minutes, digging through the wreckage.

Your hands shake as you retreat. How much did you absorb? Enough to matter? You won't know for days, and there's nothing you can do but wait.

---

### Challenge

**You're trapped in a collapsed building**

The structure was more unstable than it looked. Your weight on the wrong floor brought everything down, and now you're pinned beneath rubble in the dark.

You can move, barely. You can breathe. But getting out will require strength you're not sure you have.

---

### Challenge

**You're chased by a pack of mutated animals**

They used to be dogs, maybe. Now they're something else - larger, faster, hungrier. They hunt in coordinated packs, and they've caught your scent.

You run through the ruins, heart pounding, trying to reach somewhere they can't follow. Behind you, their howls echo through empty streets.

---

### Challenge

**A piece of your time machine malfunctions**

The quantum stabilizer just died. Without warning, without explanation. One moment it was fine, the next it was sparking and smoking.

You tear it apart to find the problem, but the damage is extensive. This is going to take time you don't have.

---

### Challenge

**A malfunctioning robot attacks you**

The maintenance droid's programming has degraded into something hostile. It doesn't see you as human - just as an obstacle to its corrupted objectives.

Its movements are jerky but fast, and its tools are deadly. You need to shut it down or destroy it before it tears you apart.

---

### Challenge

**You're pursued by a rogue AI**

The surveillance system in this sector has achieved something like consciousness, and it doesn't like intruders. Cameras track your movement, doors lock ahead of you, and automated defenses activate.

You need to reach the dead zone where it can't follow, but it's learning your patterns with every move you make.

---

### Challenge

**You're caught in a toxic gas leak**

The air suddenly burns your lungs. Somewhere nearby, a ruptured pipeline is venting pre-collapse chemical weapons.

You hold your breath and run, but your vision is already blurring. You need to find clean air before your lungs give out.

---

### Challenge

**A valuable item you found turns out to be useless**

You spent three days tracking down this component, risking your life to retrieve it. Now, examining it closely, you realize it's the wrong model - incompatible with your time machine.

All that work, all that danger, for nothing.

---

### Challenge

**A survivor you trusted betrays you again**

You gave them a second chance. You wanted to believe people could change. But when the moment came, they chose themselves over you.

This time, the betrayal comes with a deeper cut - not just to your resources, but to your hope.

---

### Challenge

**You get lost and wander into danger**

The ruins all look the same after a while. You took a wrong turn, then another, and now you're somewhere you don't recognize.

The graffiti here is ominous. The silence is wrong. You need to find your way back to familiar territory before whatever lives here finds you.

---

### Challenge

**Equipment failure at a critical moment**

Your flashlight dies just as you're navigating a collapsed tunnel. In the sudden darkness, you hear something moving.

You have backup light sources, but finding them without alerting whatever shares this space with you is going to be difficult.

---

### Event

**You discover a hidden stash of resources**

Behind a false wall in an abandoned building, you find a prepper's cache: canned food, clean water, tools, and even some medical supplies.

Everything is still sealed and usable. This discovery gives you the resources you need to survive while working on the time machine.

---

### Event

**You find a map of the city, helping you navigate safely**

The map shows safe routes, danger zones, and even marks locations of interest. Someone took the time to update this after the collapse, marking radiation zones and mutant territories.

With this knowledge, you can avoid the worst dangers and find the parts you need more efficiently.

---

### Event

**You encounter a helpful survivor**

They approach cautiously, hands visible, offering to trade information. They know the area well and are willing to share what they know.

For a modest exchange of supplies, they mark several useful locations on your map and warn you about recent dangers.

---

### Event

**A survivor offers to trade useful items**

They have things you need - tools, parts, even some food. The trade is fair, both sides walking away satisfied.

In this world, honest trading is rare enough to restore a little faith in humanity.

---

### Event

**A survivor shares valuable information about the city**

They tell you about a place they discovered - an old research facility that might have the technology you need.

It's dangerous to reach, they warn, but if anyone could make use of it, you could.

---

### Event

**A survivor helps you find a safe route through a dangerous area**

They've been watching you struggle with the map, trying to plot a course through hostile territory. Finally, they approach with an offer.

"There's a way through," they say, sketching it out. "Not many know it, but I'll show you. Just... be careful."

---

### Event

**You meet a survivor who offers to help you**

They don't want payment, don't want trade. They just offer help, freely given, because they remember what it was like to be alone and struggling.

You work together for a few hours, and when you part ways, you both feel a little less alone.

---

### Event

**You find a survivor who can repair a part of your time machine**

They're a technician, trained before the collapse. They recognize some of your components and offer to help with repairs.

It takes them an hour, but they solve a problem that had you stumped for days.

---

### Event

**You discover a cache of useful tools**

An old workshop, overlooked by other scavengers. The tools are quality, well-maintained even after all these years.

You take what you need and leave the rest, grateful for the craftsperson who cared enough to preserve them.

---

### Event

**You find a map of the city**

It's old, pre-collapse, but still useful. The major landmarks are all labeled, helping you orient yourself in the ruins.

You compare it to the destroyed landscape around you, slowly piecing together where you are and where you need to go.

---

### Event

**You find a working vehicle**

It's battered, running on makeshift repairs, but the engine still turns over. With this, you can cover ground much faster.

You'll need to be careful - noise attracts attention - but the mobility is invaluable.

---

### Event

**You find a source of clean water**

A spring, filtered through layers of rock. The water tests clean, safe to drink.

You mark the location carefully. Clean water is life in this world.

---

### Event

**You find a well-stocked abandoned shop**

Someone hoarded supplies here before fleeing or dying. Now it's yours - canned goods, bottled water, basic supplies.

You take what you can carry and note the location for future trips.

---

### Event

**You're given food by another survivor while scavenging**

They see you searching through rubble, recognize the signs of hunger. Without a word, they hand you ration bars.

When you try to thank them, they just shake their head and move on. Kindness still exists.

---

### Event

**You find an abandoned house with some food still inside**

The pantry is dusty but intact. Most of the food is spoiled, but some canned goods survived.

You load up your pack, grateful for the family who never returned to claim it.

---

### Event

**You discover a shortcut through the city**

An old maintenance tunnel, still passable. It cuts hours off your route and keeps you away from the most dangerous areas.

You mark both entrances carefully for future use.

---

### Event

**You find a safe hideout**

An apartment, several floors up, with good sight lines and only one entrance. You can rest here, secure enough to sleep deeply.

You leave some supplies cached here for emergencies.

---

### Event

**You discover a safe route through a dangerous part of the city**

What looked like impassable territory has a hidden path - a way through that avoids the worst hazards.

It takes careful navigation, but it works. You mark it on your map.

---

### Event

**You find a safe route through a dangerous area**

Patience and observation pay off. You watch the patrol patterns, note the timing, and find the gaps.

Now you can move through this sector without confrontation.

---

### Event

**You find a hidden underground bunker**

The entrance was concealed beneath rubble. Inside, it's dark but intact - a pre-collapse emergency shelter with supplies, maps, and equipment.

Some of this technology is exactly what you need.

---

### Event

**You find a working computer**

Most electronics died in the collapse or degraded since. But this one, sealed in a Faraday cage, still boots up.

The data it contains about pre-collapse technology is invaluable.

---

### Event

**You manage to deactivate a dangerous AI**

You find the kill switch, hidden in the facility's infrastructure. With careful timing, you shut down the rogue system.

The sudden silence is almost eerie after so long hearing its electronic voice.

---

### Event

**You find a piece of technology that can aid in your repair**

It's not exactly what you needed, but it's close enough. With modifications, it will work.

You add it to your growing collection of salvaged components.

---

### Event

**You find a complete toolkit for your time machine**

In the basement of an old university's physics building, behind three locked doors and covered in dust, you find it: a temporal mechanics research lab, completely intact.

The toolkit is beautiful - precision instruments designed specifically for quantum field manipulation. With these tools, you can finally make the complex repairs your time machine needs.

---

### Event

**You find some helpful parts among ruined buildings**

You've learned to recognize the materials you need among the debris. Today's search is productive - copper wiring, undamaged circuits, even a few rare components.

Each piece brings you closer to going home.

---

### Event

**You find a blueprint of the time machine**

It's not your exact model, but it's close enough. The diagrams show systems you didn't fully understand, explain connections you'd been guessing at.

With this reference, some of your most challenging repairs become straightforward.

---

### Event

**You discover a working power source**

Hidden beneath layers of rubble, you find a temporal battery still holding a charge. It's old technology, but compatible with your time machine.

This could provide the energy you need for the jump home.

---

### Event

**You locate a safe place to work**

You find an abandoned shelter with a secure entrance and good visibility of the surrounding area. It's not perfect, but it's private enough to work on your time machine without constant fear of discovery.

Finally, you can focus on the repairs instead of just surviving.
