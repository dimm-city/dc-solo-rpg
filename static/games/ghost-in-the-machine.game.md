title: Ghost in the Machine
subtitle: A Dimm City Solo Campaign
win-message: You slip through Drift Gate 7 as it cycles, the stolen neuralware finally synced to your consciousness. The augmerc's roar fades behind you as reality fractures and reforms. You're free—for now. But in Dimm City, freedom is just another word for "running faster."
lose-message: The augmerc's chrome claws find you at last. As your vision fractures into static and the smell of burnt ozone fills your lungs, you realize the Machine always wins. The Tech District claims another ghost.
---

## Who You Are

**You are an etherlock—one of the rare Sporos who can see where reality glitches, where the code of the world frays at the edges.**

Most DimmCitz think you're mad. Maybe they're right. You see things that shouldn't exist: fragmenting shadows in fluorescent light, conversations echoing from rooms that don't have doors, advertisements that speak directly into your skull. The Tech District's infrastructure is riddled with holes where the digital bleeds into the real, and you've learned to slip through those cracks like water through broken pipes.

You're a fox—rust-red fur matted with grime, one eye replaced with a salvaged optic implant that flickers with stolen code. Your claws are stained with solder burns and your tail twitches with nervous energy. Three days ago, you were nobody. Just another wirephreak hustling data-pulls and system cracks for enough credits to keep breathing.

Then you saw it: an augmerc passed out in an alley behind Last Bite, fresh off a bad batch of synthetic euphoria. A wolf, massive and chrome-plated, with military-grade neuralware jutting from his skull like a crown of thorns. The kind of augmentation that costs more than you'd see in ten stretches. The kind that screams corporate enforcer, black ops, the sort of merc who disappears people for asking the wrong questions.

You didn't think. You just _moved_.

## What Happened

**The heist took thirty ticks. The consequences have lasted three days.**

Your claws worked fast, disconnecting the neuralware module from the augmerc's cerebral socket. The tech was still warm, pulsing with bioelectric rhythm. You could feel it humming—not just machinery, but something alive, something _aware_. The moment you touched it, visions flooded your mind: classified security protocols, corporate kill-lists, encrypted channels to people who don't officially exist.

You pocketed the hardware and ran.

He woke up screaming. You heard it six blocks away—a howl of rage that made the neon signs flicker and crack. The sound of chrome claws scraping concrete. The Tech District's surveillance grid lit up like a wildfire, every camera swiveling to track your signature. Corporate security drones began their patrol cycles early. Lockdown protocols activated in sectors you'd never even heard of.

The augmerc wants his property back. No—he wants _you_ back. Wants to peel your skull open and retrieve what you stole, then leave your carcass in the gutter as a message. The neuralware you grabbed isn't just expensive. It's _connected_—linked to systems you don't understand, encryptions you can barely perceive. Every tick you keep it, it digs deeper into your nervous system, showing you things you were never meant to see.

Corporate kill-squads are mobilizing. The merc's connections run deep—deeper than the transit tunnels, deeper than the data-stacks in the server farms. You've got no allies, no safe houses, no exit strategy. Just the clothes on your back, the stolen tech burning against your ribs, and the growing certainty that the walls are closing in.

The Etherwave Transit Hub is your only shot. Drift Gate 7 cycles every few shorties, opening portals to other districts—if you can reach it before lockdown goes total. If you can sync the neuralware to your own wetware before it rejects and fries your brain. If you can survive long enough to become the ghost the augmerc thinks you already are.

## Your Goal

**Reach Drift Gate 7 and escape the Tech District before the augmerc catches you or the stolen neuralware kills you from the inside.**

The neuralware is integrating with your nervous system—you can feel it worming through your synapses like ice-cold fingers. Every shorty brings new capabilities, new visions, new _pain_. You're seeing through security cameras now, hearing encrypted chatter in languages you don't speak, tasting ozone when data-packets route through nearby servers.

But integration takes time, and time is the one thing you don't have. The augmerc is hunting. The corporations want you silenced. The Tech District's infrastructure is turning against you, every terminal and transit-pod a potential trap.

Survive. Adapt. Escape. In Dimm City, that's the only prayer that ever gets answered.

---

## Card Deck

### Primary Success

**The neuralware finally syncs—you see everything, and you know exactly how to disappear.**

The pain stops. Not gradually, not with mercy—it just _ends_, like a switch flipping in your brain. The stolen tech completes its integration, and suddenly you're not fighting it anymore. You're _using_ it.

Every camera in the Tech District becomes your eyes. Every locked door whispers its override codes. You see the patrol patterns of security drones mapped in three-dimensional space, their predictable routes glowing like neon threads. The Etherwave Transit Hub's schedule unfolds before you—Drift Gate 7 will cycle in exactly forty-three ticks, and you know precisely which maintenance tunnel to use, which guard to avoid, which moment of electromagnetic interference will blank the sensors long enough for you to slip through.

The augmerc is three blocks away, his chrome bulk tearing through a crowd of late-shift factory workers. You can hear his frustrated snarl through a nearby speaker-grill. He's fast, but you're faster now. You're not just running anymore—you're _phasing_, slipping through reality's cracks like you were born to it.

Drift Gate 7 shimmers ahead, its reality-distortion field making the air taste like copper and starlight. You run.

---

### Failure Counter

**The augmerc's network activates—corporate kill-squads mobilize across the district.**

You catch the transmission on a hijacked frequency: "Target confirmed. Sector 7-Gamma. Authorization granted for lethal retrieval. Collateral damage acceptable."

The smell of ozone intensifies as pulse cannons power up in automated turrets you didn't even know existed. The Tech District's corporate overlords have decided you're worth the expense. Not because you're dangerous—because you embarrassed them. Because a nobody fox wirephreak made their prize enforcer look weak.

Red targeting lasers paint the walls around you. Somewhere above, you hear the whistle-scream of security drones changing their patrol pattern. All of them converging on you.

---

### Failure Counter

**The neuralware rejects violently—your body fights the foreign technology.**

Your vision fractures into static. Blood—your blood—drips from your nose, tasting of copper and burnt circuits. The stolen tech is trying to rewrite your nervous system, and your body is _screaming_ its refusal.

Your limbs move wrong, jerking like a puppet with tangled strings. The optic implant in your left eye flares white-hot, and for a horrible moment you can see through walls, through flesh, through the fundamental code of reality itself. Then it all goes dark except for error messages scrolling endlessly across your retinas.

You collapse against a rusted dumpster, retching acid and bile. The neuralware is killing you from the inside. Maybe that's mercy compared to what the augmerc will do.

---

### Failure Counter

**You're trapped in a lockdown zone—all exits sealed, security closing in.**

The corporate towers loom overhead as blast doors slam shut with hydraulic finality. You're in Sector 12-Theta, a manufacturing sub-level that just went into full quarantine protocol. Red emergency lights pulse like a dying heartbeat. Klaxons wail.

The air tastes like machine oil and desperation. Your claws scrape uselessly against reinforced titanium as you search for any crack, any weakness. Nothing. The Tech District has you in a box, and the box is getting smaller.

Through the walls, you hear them coming: chrome boots on concrete, the mechanical whir of pulse weapons charging. The augmerc's laugh echoes through the PA system, distorted and cruel.

"Nowhere left to run, little fox."

---

### Failure Counter

**The augmerc finds you—chrome claws and murder in his eyes.**

He's massive. Bigger than you remembered. The wolf towers over you, his chrome-plated body reflecting the flickering neon in broken rainbows. Where his neuralware should be, there's just an empty socket weeping fluid and sparking electricity.

"You took something from me," he growls, and his voice is razors dragged across sheet metal. "I'm taking it back. Along with your spine."

His claws extend—military-grade adamantine, designed to tear through armored vehicles. You smell burnt oil and old blood on his fur. This is it. The Machine always wins.

---

### Narrative: skip-damage

**You find a reality glitch at exactly the right moment—danger phases right through you.**

The wall _fractures_. Not physically—it's still there, still solid rust-stained concrete. But you can see where it's _wrong_, where the code stutters and skips. An etherlock's gift, finally useful for more than madness.

You press your palm against the impossible space and _push_.

Reality bends. For one dizzy moment you're in two places at once, your consciousness splitting like corrupted data. Then you're through, standing on the other side of what should have been solid matter. Behind you, you hear your pursuers crash into the wall at full speed, confusion in their shouts.

The glitch fades, sealing behind you. Your head pounds and your mouth tastes like static electricity, but you're alive. The next danger that comes, you'll be ready. You've learned this trick now.

---

### Narrative: return-king

**The neuralware shows you a way to undo what seemed irreversible.**

The stolen tech pulses against your ribs, and suddenly you _see_ it—a cascade of probability threads spreading out from this moment like a spider's web. The augmerc's network, the corporate lockdown, the security protocols—they're all just _code_, and code can be rewritten.

Your claws move without conscious thought, interfacing with a nearby terminal. The neuralware floods your mind with access keys you shouldn't have, backdoors you shouldn't know exist. You're rewriting recent history in the district's security logs, creating just enough chaos and contradiction to reset their response protocols.

Suddenly, you have a second chance. The catastrophe you thought was locked in stone starts to _unravel_, threads of causality rewinding like tape in reverse. Not completely—you can't undo everything. But you can buy yourself breathing room.

The Machine may always win eventually. But not today. Not this tick.

---

### Narrative

**You remember why you're fighting—a moment of crystalline clarity amid the chaos.**

You're crouched in an abandoned server farm, surrounded by the hum of dying machines and the smell of burnt insulation. Through a cracked window, you can see the Tech District sprawled out below: a circuit board of light and shadow, beauty and brutality intertwined.

This city doesn't love you. Never has, never will. But it's _yours_ in a way the augmerc will never understand. Every DimmCitz hustling to survive, every wirephreak pulling impossible jobs just to eat—they're your people, even if you'll never speak to them.

You close your eyes and let the neuralware show you what it knows: a vision of freedom, of transit gates and open sky, of possibilities beyond this chrome-plated nightmare. It's not hope, exactly. Hope is for shorties who haven't lived in Dimm City long enough.

But it's something. And something is enough to keep running.

---

### Challenge

**Corporate security drones swarm your location—pulse cannons tracking your heat signature.**

The air fills with the whine of servo-motors and targeting computers. Six drones, maybe seven, their carapaces gleaming black chrome. Pulse cannons swivel with mechanical precision, painting you in overlapping fields of crimson targeting light.

You smell ozone building as capacitors charge. The first shot scorches the air where you were standing half a tick ago. The concrete wall explodes in a shower of superheated debris. Your ears ring. Your fur smokes.

They're herding you toward the killbox. You need to move _now_.

---

### Challenge

**The augmerc's scent is getting closer—you can hear his chrome claws scraping concrete.**

That sound. Scrape-click-scrape-click, methodical and patient. He's not rushing anymore. He knows the district is locked down, knows you're running out of places to hide. He's _savoring_ this.

You catch his scent on the recycled air: gun oil, blood, the acrid chemical smell of combat drugs. Your instincts scream _predator_, and every fiber of your being wants to curl up and hide. But there's nowhere to hide anymore.

The scraping stops. Silence, somehow worse than the sound. Then his voice, echoing from somewhere too close: "I can smell your fear, little fox."

---

### Challenge

**Transit security lockdown—checkpoints activating across all major routes.**

The Etherwave Hub's entrance shimmers ahead, so close you can taste the reality-distortion field. Then the blast doors slam down with hydraulic fury, cutting off your path. Armored guards in corporate livery materialize from side passages, their visors reflecting your desperate expression.

"Halt! Submit to security scan!"

The scanners will find the neuralware instantly. You'll be detained, processed, disappeared. The augmerc won't even have to get his claws dirty—the corporations will gift-wrap you for him.

---

### Challenge

**The neuralware glitches catastrophically—visions and pain flood your senses.**

ERROR. ERROR. ERROR.

The world fragments into a thousand overlapping realities. You see the street as it is now, as it was ten years ago, as it will be in some impossible future. Your body forgets how to breathe. The neuralware is trying to process information your organic brain was never meant to handle.

You collapse, twitching, as sensory data overloads every synapse. You taste colors. You hear textures. The pavement feels like screaming.

Somewhere distant, you hear the augmerc's triumphant howl. He knows you're vulnerable.

---

### Challenge

**Maintenance tunnel collapse—you're trapped in flooding darkness.**

The tunnel gives way without warning. Rust-weakened supports finally surrender to time and pressure. You're falling through darkness, landing hard in freezing water that stinks of industrial waste and things better left unidentified.

The water's rising fast. Your exit is buried under tons of rubble. Your optic implant flickers, casting horror-show shadows on the walls. Something moves in the water beside you—something with too many legs and eyes that glow bioluminescent green.

Your claws scrabble against slick concrete, searching for any handhold, any way up and out.

---

### Challenge

**Corporate enforcers corner you in a dead-end alley—nowhere to run.**

Three of them. Rhinoceros Sporos, massive and chrome-augmented, blocking the only exit. Their pulse rifles hum with barely contained violence. Behind you: a wall fifty feet high, smooth as glass.

"Target acquired," one rumbles, his voice like grinding gears. "Drop the stolen property and you die quick."

The smell of cordite and burnt metal fills your nostrils. Your heart hammers against your ribs where the neuralware pulses in sympathetic rhythm. This is bad. This is very bad.

---

### Challenge

**System-wide power surge fries your optic implant—half-blind and disoriented.**

The surge hits without warning: every light in the sector flaring nova-bright before dying completely. Your optic implant screams error codes directly into your visual cortex, then goes dark, leaving phantom static burned across your retinas.

You're half-blind now, stumbling through darkness you can't fully perceive. Your remaining organic eye adjusts slowly, too slowly. Every shadow could be a threat. Every sound could be death approaching.

The neuralware tries to compensate, feeding you electromagnetic data your brain can't properly interpret. The world becomes a confusing mess of heat signatures and radio frequencies. You trip over debris you couldn't see, crash into walls you didn't know were there.

---

### Challenge

**Rooftop chase—security closing in from all sides, nowhere left to go but down.**

You're three stories up, racing across rooftops slick with industrial runoff and old rain. Behind you: corporate security. To your left: more security. To your right: the augmerc himself, keeping pace with impossible speed despite his bulk.

Ahead: nothing. The building ends, and beyond it is just empty air and a fifty-foot drop to the street below. You can smell the ozone from the security drones circling overhead, hear the whine of their pulse cannons charging.

Jump and probably die. Stay and definitely die. Dimm City doesn't believe in good choices.

---

### Challenge

**The neuralware demands more power—it's draining your life force to maintain integration.**

You're getting weaker. You can feel it in your bones, in the way your legs shake with each step. The neuralware is hungry—feeding on your bioelectrical energy, burning through your reserves faster than your body can replenish them.

Your vision tunnels. Your coordination fails. You collapse against a wall, gasping, tasting copper and exhaustion. The stolen tech wasn't designed for an organic host. It's _killing_ you, and there's nothing you can do but keep running and hope you reach the gate before your body gives out entirely.

---

### Challenge

**Electromagnetic pulse fries nearby systems—including your only navigation aid.**

The EMP wave rolls through the district like invisible thunder. Every screen dies. Every terminal goes dark. The neuralware in your chest _screams_ a warning half a tick before the pulse hits, giving you just enough time to dive behind a dumpster.

When you emerge, your stolen map data is corrupted, your waypoints erased. You're lost in the Tech District's labyrinth with no guides, no landmarks, just your fading memory of which way might lead to the transit hub.

Behind you, the augmerc's laugh echoes. He doesn't need electronics to hunt. He has your scent.

---

### Challenge

**Toxic chemical leak in industrial sector—burning lungs and blurred vision.**

The storage tank ruptures with a hiss of escaping gas. The smell hits you like a physical blow: acrid, burning, wrong. Your eyes water instantly. Your lungs reject the air, seizing in protest.

You stumble forward, trying to hold your breath, trying to see through tears and gathering chemical fog. Your fur is matted with condensing toxins. Every breath you're forced to take tastes like death.

Somewhere ahead should be clean air. Somewhere. But the fog is thickening, and your lungs are screaming for oxygen you don't dare give them.

---

### Challenge

**Cyber-psychosis episode—the neuralware makes you see threats that aren't there.**

The walls are bleeding code. You can see it dripping down in luminescent streams, pooling on the floor in incomprehensible glyphs. The people passing by aren't people anymore—they're _things_, hollow shells filled with crawling static.

You know it's not real. The neuralware is glitching, corrupting your sensory input. But knowing doesn't help when your claws are out and you're backing into a corner, convinced that the entire world has become hostile.

How much of what you're seeing is real? How much is hallucination? The augmerc could be right in front of you and you wouldn't know until his claws found your throat.

---

### Challenge

**Security checkpoint with biometric scanners—you'll be identified instantly.**

The checkpoint looms ahead: reinforced barriers, armed guards, scanners that can read your DNA from thirty feet away. There's no way around it—this passage is the only route to your destination.

Your stolen neuralware is already flagged in every corporate database. The moment those scanners touch you, alarms will scream. Every guard in the district will know exactly where you are.

You could try to bluff through. You could try to run. Neither option ends well. But standing here debating isn't an option either—you hear pursuit getting closer.

---

### Challenge

**The augmerc sets an ambush—crude but effective.**

You round the corner and realize your mistake instantly. It's too quiet. The normal sounds of the Tech District—the hum of machinery, the chatter of crowds, the endless advertisements—they're all absent.

Then you see him. The wolf, sitting perfectly still in the center of the intersection, chrome gleaming under flickering neon. He's been waiting for you. He _knew_ you'd come this way.

"Hello, little fox," he rumbles. "End of the line."

Behind you, you hear the blast doors slamming shut. He's herded you here perfectly. Trapped you like the prey you are.

---

### Challenge

**Structural damage from previous corporate war—building collapse imminent.**

The warning signs are everywhere: cracked support beams, tilting floors, the groan of tortured metal and concrete. This building is a casualty of some corporate conflict from years ago, left to rot because repairs cost more than demolition rights.

And you're inside it. On the third floor. When the first support gives way with a sound like a gunshot.

The floor lurches. Ceiling tiles rain down. Somewhere below, you hear the CASCADE beginning—one failure triggering another, entire sections of structure surrendering to gravity. You have maybe thirty ticks to get out before the whole thing comes down.

---

### Challenge

**Desperate cornered by gang enforcers who mistake you for someone else.**

They're cats—Entertainment District muscle who've wandered into Tech territory. Young, chrome-plated, high on synthetic aggression and looking for violence. Their leader, a scarred tabby with retractable blade implants, blocks your path.

"You're the wirephreak who doxxed the Neon Lords," she hisses. "Boss wants your tail as a trophy."

You're not. You've never even _seen_ the Neon Lords. But these shorties aren't interested in explanations—they're interested in proving themselves. And you're in no condition to fight your way through three augmented gang enforcers.

---

### Event

**You find an abandoned wirephreak safe house—momentary shelter.**

The door is hidden behind a glitching hologram ad, exactly where your gut told you to look. Inside: a cramped space that smells like old coffee and burnt circuits, barely large enough to turn around in. But it's _safe_, at least for now.

Someone left supplies: a half-full canteen of clean water, energy bars that taste like cardboard and optimism, a charging port that still works. You drink. You eat. You let yourself breathe for the first time in shorties.

On the wall, scratched in permanent marker: "Keep running. The Machine doesn't win if you don't stop."

You almost smile.

---

### Event

**Chance encounter with a sympathetic Sporo—they create a distraction.**

The rat wirephreak sees you cornered, sees the pursuit closing in. You've never met her before—she's just another DimmCitz trying to survive. But she sees something in your desperate eyes that resonates.

"Hey! Corporate goons! Your mother was a refurbished toaster!"

She bolts, drawing half the security detail after her with the sheer audacity of her insult. It's not much. It won't save you. But it gives you ten ticks to slip into a side alley, and sometimes ten ticks is the difference between living and dying.

You don't even know her name. But you owe her your life.

---

### Event

**You discover a forgotten maintenance passage—a shortcut toward the transit hub.**

The vent grate is rusted nearly through, easy to pry open. Beyond: darkness and the smell of machine oil, but also a current of air that suggests this tunnel goes _somewhere_.

You squeeze through, your lean fox frame barely fitting. The passage is cramped and filthy, but it runs parallel to the main thoroughfare—away from checkpoints, away from cameras. Your neuralware flickers, showing you a ghostly map: this passage connects to the transit hub's sub-basement.

It's not safety. Nothing in Dimm City is safe. But it's progress, and progress is a kind of grace.

---

### Event

**You hack a corporate terminal—valuable intel on security patrol patterns.**

The terminal is half-dead, its screen cracked and flickering. But your claws dance across the interface, the stolen neuralware feeding you access codes faster than conscious thought. The corporate network opens like a flower made of light.

You see it all: patrol routes, shift changes, blind spots in camera coverage. The district's security grid laid bare. Knowledge that might keep you alive another shorty.

You download what you can, memorize the rest. Then you wipe your access logs and vanish before anyone notices the intrusion.

---

### Event

**Scavenged medical supplies help with your injuries.**

The first aid station is long abandoned, probably left over from some corporate wellness initiative that died with the last quarter's profits. But the supplies are still good: antiseptic that burns like liquid fire, synthetic skin patches, pain suppressors that taste like copper.

You tend your wounds as best you can. The burns from pulse cannon near-misses. The lacerations from razor-wire fences. The bruises that go bone-deep. You're not a medic, but desperation makes everyone an expert.

The pain recedes to a dull roar. It's not healing—not really. But it's enough to keep moving.

---

### Event

**The neuralware reveals a hidden backdoor in the security system.**

The revelation comes like lightning: a cascade of data showing you something the system's designers never intended anyone to see. A _flaw_. A beautiful, exploitable flaw in the security architecture.

You can't use it yet—the timing has to be perfect. But you know it's there now, waiting for the right moment. A secret weapon against the Machine that thinks it owns you.

You file the knowledge away like a blade kept for desperate occasions.

---

### Event

**Rain begins to fall—the smell of ozone masks your scent.**

The precipitation starts as a fine mist, then builds to a proper downpour. The Tech District's eternal rain, acidic and cold, washing the streets clean of blood and promises. It soaks through your fur, makes you shiver, turns every surface slick and treacherous.

But it also does something beautiful: it dilutes your scent trail, confuses the augmerc's tracking. You can almost hear his frustrated snarl from somewhere in the district's labyrinth.

You tilt your face to the sky and let the rain wash away your fear, just for a moment.

---

### Event

**You find a functioning public terminal—chance to send a message.**

The terminal flickers to life under your claws. You've got maybe ninety ticks before someone traces the access. Who do you message? You've got no allies, no backup.

But there are rumors. Whispers of resistance cells in The Archives. Wirefreaks who've escaped corporate control. Maybe they don't exist. Maybe they do.

You type out coordinates, timestamp, situation report. Send it to dead-drop addresses you've collected over the years. Probably nothing will come of it.

But maybe—just maybe—someone will see. Someone will care.

---

### Event

**Distant explosion draws security away from your position.**

The blast shakes the ground, loud enough to trigger car alarms three blocks away. You see the fireball rising above the corporate towers—something big just went catastrophically wrong in the industrial sector.

Every security drone in your vicinity abandons their patrol routes, converging on the emergency. The corporate goons chasing you get new orders, peel away toward the crisis. For precious ticks, you're alone and unwatched.

You don't know who's responsible for the explosion. Don't care. You just run while the Machine is distracted.

---

### Event

**You remember a valuable trick from your wirephreak days.**

The security panel looks impenetrable—military-grade encryption, biometric locks, the works. Any normal wirephreak would need shorties to crack it.

But you're not normal anymore. You've got stolen corporate neuralware integrated with your nervous system. And you remember something from years ago: an exploit, ancient and probably patched, but maybe, just maybe...

Your claws interface with the panel. The neuralware floods your consciousness with raw data. And the ancient exploit _works_. The lock disengages with a satisfying click.

Sometimes experience beats cutting-edge security. Sometimes.

---

### Event

**Brief moment of beauty—bioluminescent fungi growing in the shadows.**

You pause in your flight, arrested by impossible beauty: pale blue fungi growing from cracks in the concrete, glowing softly like captive starlight. They shouldn't exist here in the Tech District—they're Archive flora, toxic and strange.

But they're beautiful. In all this chrome and blood and terror, something beautiful and alive has found a way to exist.

You breathe in their faintly sweet scent, let yourself remember that the world contains more than violence. Then you keep running, but the memory goes with you like a talisman.

---

### Event

**You discover fresh water from a broken pipe—slake your desperate thirst.**

The pipe burst days ago, probably, judging by the rust stains. But the water pooling beneath it is clean—or at least cleaner than anything else you're likely to find. You lap at it desperately, your parched tongue finally finding relief.

It tastes like metal and infrastructure, but it's _water_. Your body thanks you with a surge of renewed energy. You even splash some on your face, washing away dried blood and grime.

Small victories. In Dimm City, you take what you can get.

---

### Event

**Overheard conversation reveals the augmerc's weakness.**

You're pressed into a shadowy alcove when you hear them: two corporate security talking on their break.

"Did you hear about that augmerc? The wolf hunting the wirephreak?"

"Yeah. Brass is pissed. Apparently his neuralware was more than just hardware—it was keeping his combat trauma in check. Without it, he's unstable. Dangerous even to friendlies."

"So he's getting _worse_ the longer this drags out?"

"Much worse. Give it another stretch and he'll be completely feral."

They move on. You stay hidden, processing this revelation. The augmerc isn't just angry—he's _deteriorating_. Time might be on your side after all.

---

### Event

**You find discarded but functional tech—scavenge useful components.**

The trash heap outside the corporate tower contains treasures: a portable EMP generator missing its power cell, some signal jammers still in their packaging, cables and connectors in every configuration.

Your wirephreak instincts kick in. You've got a power cell salvaged three districts ago. The EMP generator will work if you bypass the safety limiters. The signal jammers might buy you precious ticks when you need them.

You stuff what you can carry into your pockets, leaving the rest for whatever scavenger comes next. In Dimm City, everyone shares the table scraps.

---

### Event

**Corporate security checkpoint, but they're looking for someone else.**

You approach the checkpoint with your heart in your throat, ready to bolt. The guard scans you with bored efficiency, barely glancing at the results.

"Move along," he grunts.

You were ready to fight, flee, die. But he's _not looking for you_. The security net isn't as tight as you feared. Maybe the explosion earlier scrambled their priorities. Maybe you're just lucky.

You don't question it. You just walk through, carefully casual, and disappear into the crowd on the other side.

---

### Event

**You spot a security blind spot—a camera array with dead zones.**

The neuralware highlights it for you: overlapping camera coverage that _should_ be complete, but isn't. A gap in the grid, probably due to budget cuts or maintenance neglect. Just large enough for someone your size to slip through unseen.

You memorize the location, the timing. It might be nothing. Might be the difference between capture and escape.

Every advantage matters when the Machine wants you dead.

---

### Event

**Night falls—darkness provides better cover.**

The Tech District's neon never truly dies, but the sodium street-lamps do cycle down after a certain hour. The shadows deepen. The crowds thin. Surveillance drones switch to thermal imaging, which means they're easier to predict.

You're a creature of shadows and desperation. Darkness is your ally. You slip through the dimming streets like smoke, like a ghost, like the thing the augmerc thinks he's hunting.

Maybe he's right. Maybe you're becoming something more than a wirephreak with stolen tech. Maybe you're becoming the nightmare that haunts nightmares.

---

### Event

**You find an old etherlock shrine—moment of spiritual connection.**

The shrine is barely recognizable: faded offerings, broken incense burners, symbols scratched into concrete by claws like yours. A place where etherlocks once gathered to honor the spaces between spaces, the glitches where reality shows its seams.

You press your palm against the wall and _feel_ it: the presence of others like you, their residual energy staining the fabric of the world. You're not alone. You've never been alone.

The shrines remember. The city remembers. And for one crystalline moment, you remember why being an etherlock isn't just madness—it's _purpose_.

---

### Event

**Helpful graffiti—local wirefreaks leaving coded warnings.**

The symbols are spray-painted on the wall in UV-reactive ink, visible only to those with augmented optics: "DRONES SECTOR 9. AVOID." "MERCSERCS TUNNEL 7-B." "SAFE HOUSE GAMMA COMPROMISED."

It's a wirephreak information network, invisible to corporate security, shared among the desperate and skilled. You're not the first to run this route. Others have been here, survived, left breadcrumbs for whoever comes next.

You add your own mark: a fox pawprint and a warning about the augmerc's patrol pattern. Then you move on, grateful for the community you never knew you had.

---

### Event

**Street vendor offers free food—small kindness from a stranger.**

The raccoon running the food cart sees you: bedraggled, desperate, running from something. She doesn't ask questions. Just slides a container of noodles across the counter.

"On the house, shorty. You look like you need it."

The noodles are cheap synthetic protein and recycled carbs, but they're _warm_ and they're _free_ and they're offered with something that might be compassion. You eat standing up, trying not to cry.

"Stay safe out there," she says as you leave.

You can't remember the last time someone told you that and meant it.

---

### Event

**You discover an unlocked emergency exit—quick escape route if needed.**

The emergency exit should be alarmed, should trigger security protocols. But the sensor is broken, hanging by corroded wires. The door opens smoothly, revealing a stairwell that descends into useful darkness.

You wedge it open with a piece of debris, memorize the location. If pursuit gets too close, this is your exit. This is how you disappear.

The city provides, sometimes. Usually when you're not looking.

### Event

**Meditation in hiding—the neuralware shows you calm within chaos.**

You're crammed into a ventilation shaft, barely breathing, listening to security sweep the area below. But instead of panic, the neuralware floods you with unexpected _serenity_.

You see the pursuit as data patterns. The threats as mathematical probabilities. Your own fear as merely elevated cortisol levels. The tech translates terror into numbers, and numbers can be understood, managed, overcome.

Your heart rate slows. Your breathing steadies. When the security passes, you emerge not as panicked prey but as a creature who has found calm in the eye of the storm.

### Event

**You notice corporate security is spread dangerously thin—the system is overwhelmed.**

Too many crises. Too few enforcers. The explosion earlier, plus standard crime, plus hunting you—the Tech District's security apparatus is _straining_. You can see it in how long response times are getting, how many cameras stay broken, how exhausted the guards look.

The Machine is powerful, but it's not infinite. It can be overwhelmed. It can _fail_.

The knowledge doesn't make you safe. But it makes you hopeful, which is almost the same thing.

### Event

**Local musician playing in the street—music soothes your frayed nerves.**

The badger has a beat-up sound system and a voice like gravel and honey. She's playing old Dimm City blues, the kind that acknowledges suffering without surrender. A small crowd has gathered, swaying.

You linger at the edge, letting the music wash over you. For ninety ticks, you're not running. You're just another DimmCitz listening to someone sing about survival and defiance.

The augmerc could be one block away. Death could be coming. But right now, there's music, and that's enough.

### Event

**You find someone else's emergency stash—they won't mind sharing.**

The hiding spot is clever: inside a hollowed-out brick, covered with a false facade. But your wirephreak eye caught the irregularity. Inside: credits, a disposable commlink, some high-grade painkillers.

You take half the credits, leave the rest. The wirephreak code: take what you need to survive, leave enough for the next desperate shorty. Whoever hid this stash understands. They'd do the same.

Community exists even in a city that teaches you to trust no one.

### Event

**Brief system glitch—all surveillance goes offline for precious seconds.**

The power flicker is barely perceptible to organics, but your neuralware screams the alert: total surveillance dropout across three city blocks. Ninety ticks of absolute blindness.

You _move_. Covering distance that would normally take shorties, racing through zones you'd never dare enter under normal circumstances. When the systems reboot, you're six blocks away and the security net has no idea how you got there.

Sometimes the Machine glitches. And sometimes, that's all the advantage you need.

### Event

**Children playing remind you what you're fighting to protect.**

They're young Sporos—kittens and pups and cubs—playing some elaborate game in a condemned lot. They shouldn't be here. It's not safe. But they're _playing_, and their laughter rings through the Tech District like defiance.

You watch from the shadows, remembering when you were that young, that free, that certain the world held more possibility than pain. You're running to survive, yes. But you're also running so that these kids can keep playing, keep laughing, keep believing in something better.

It's not hope. But it's close enough to keep your legs moving.

### Event

**Perfect hiding spot—you catch your breath and plan next moves.**

The service closet is small, dark, and smells like cleaning chemicals and rust. But it's _empty_ and it's _safe_ and for the first time in what feels like forever, you can stop moving.

You lean against the wall, letting your pounding heart slow. The neuralware pulses steadily against your ribs, no longer fighting your biology. It's integrating. Slowly, painfully, but _integrating_.

You review your mental map. Calculate distances. Consider options. You're not there yet. But you're closer than you were. And sometimes, closer is all you need to keep going.
