# Dimm City Solo RPG


Welcome to the Dimm City Solo RPG project! This project provides a highly interactive and immersive web component that allows users to play Dimm City Solo RPG games in their browser. The Dimm City RPG is a variation of the Wretched and Alone game system. More information about the original game see the [License Attribution](#license-attribution) below.

## Overview

The Dimm City Solo RPG is a narrative-driven, solo role-playing game that takes players on a thrilling adventure that changes each time they play. The game is designed to be played alone, with the game system guiding the player through the story, presenting challenges, and shaping the narrative based on the cards that are drawn and the roll of the dice.

Our Svelte based web component encapsulates the entire game, providing a rich, interactive UI that guides the player through the game, handles game logic, and maintains game state. This component can be easily integrated into any website, providing a seamless gaming experience for users.

The web component is also highly configurable, allowing for customization of game rules, narrative content, and visual appearance. This makes it a versatile tool for creating unique RPG experiences for each site, game, and player.

## Easy Game Creation

The game creation process for the DC Solo RPG system is designed to be easy for anyone. The three steps to create a game are:

1. Download the game templates
1. Modify the `config.yml` file that holds the game configuration, such as the title, subtitle, introduction, and more.
2. Modify the description of each card in the `deck.csv` file to provide the card text.
3. Modify the `theme.css` file to achieve the desired visual style, such as colors, fonts, and layout.

## Developing

If you would like to run this project locally and make modifications to it, you can follow these steps to get started.

Once you've cloned this project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Everything inside `src/lib` is part of your library, everything inside `src/routes` can be used as a showcase or preview app.

To create a production version of your showcase app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
